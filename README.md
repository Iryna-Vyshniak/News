## News

The test page with the latest news provides access to the latest and breaking
news for a country, for a specific category in a country. The news articles are
sorted by the publish date.

Used NEWSDATA API, retrieving the latest news allowed to build experience such
as showcasing the latest news, breaking news tickers and analyzing News to
better understand their content.

Images sometimes aren't very quality and that's why didn't use cover styles in
Grid.
